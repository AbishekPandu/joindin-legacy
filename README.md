# Joind.in (http://joind.in)

This is the source code for the Joind.in website - a resource set up to allow
events to get real-time feedback from those attending. It also gives speakers a
way to claim and track their presentations over time.

This README includes instructions for setting up joind.in. You can either install 
joind.in on an existing PHP platform, or use our vagrant setup. Note: contributors 
should start at the Contributor readme (CONTRIBUTING.md).

PLEASE NOTE: **This project is now in maintenance mode.**  Bug fixes are welcome, new features will not be accepted.

Please go to http://github.com/joindin/joindin-web2 to contribute to the next generation joind.in site: http://m.joind.in

### Welcome

Joind.in welcomes all contributors regardless of your ability or experience. We especially welcome
you if you are new to Open Source development and will provide a helping hand. To ensure that
everyone understands what we expect from our community, our projects have a [Contributor Code of
Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and by participating in the development of joind.in you agree to abide
by its terms.

## Quick Start - Using Vagrant

The virtual machine has been moved to a different repo. To use it [fork the joindin-vm](https://github.com/joindin/joindin-vm) repository and follow the instructions in there.

This VM will load all three Joind.in projects (joind.in, joindin-vm and joindin-web2).

## Extensions

### Unit Tests

There are some tests set up, which use PHPUnit; these can be found in the
src/tests directory and the src/api-v2/tests directory.  There is a phing task
configured to run them - from the root directory simply run "phing phpunit" to run
the tests. Unfortunately, there will be no output about whether the tests passed
or failed from the phing target. A better way to test when you are developing is
to run the tests from within the respective tests directory by just typing
phpunit. The phpunit.xml in each directory will configure the bootstrap as well
as any files that should not be included.

The phpunit.xml file in the src/tests directory will run all of the PHPUnit tests.
The phpunit.xml file in src/api-v2/tests will run only the API v2 unit tests.

### CODE STYLE

Please do your best to ensure that any code you contributed adheres to the
Joind.in coding style. This is roughly equivalent to the PEAR coding standard with
a couple of rules added or taken out. You can run php codesniffer using phing on an
individual file like so:

phing phpcs-human -Dfilename.php

This will run codesniffer on any file within the regular source for Joind.in or the
API-v2 source. Wildcards work as does specifying part of the path in case the
filename alone results in sniffing more files than you wanted.

To see a summary of the codesniff errors and warnings across the entire project, run

phing phpcs-human-summary

This will show the files that still need some attention.

## Global .gitignore

git has the capability to define a global gitignore file , which means you can 
set up rules on your machine to ignore everything you don't want to include in 
your commits. This works not only for this project, but for all your other
projects too.

You can define the gitignore file with a command that looks like this, where the 
last argument is the file that holds the patterns to ignore: 

    $ git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global

Octocat gives [a good starting point](https://gist.github.com/octocat/9257657) for 
what to include, but you can also ignore the files used by your editor:

    # Eclipse
    .classpath
    .project
    .settings/
    
    # Intellij
    .idea/
    *.iml
    *.iws
        
    # Maven
    log/
    target/

    # Netbeans
    nbproject/private/
